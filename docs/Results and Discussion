Results and Discussion
The Cafe Management System was successfully developed using Django as the backend framework and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. The system allows customers to browse the menu, place orders from their table, and make payments using a QR code. Chefs or admins can manage the food items directly from the admin panel.

Limitations Identified:

Currently, no login/authentication system for staff or chefs.

No order status tracking (e.g., "In Preparation", "Ready").

Lacks email or SMS notifications.

Future Enhancements:

Implement user authentication for waiters and chefs.

Add order status updates.

Integrate a dashboard for sales and analytics.
