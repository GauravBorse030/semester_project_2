Cafe Management System – Introduction:

Welcome to the Cafe Management System, a smart and interactive web-based platform designed to streamline the entire food ordering and management process inside a cafe or restaurant.

>Food Images: Every food item is showcased with a mouth-watering image to help customers decide faster.
