--------------Problem Statement---------------
In many small and medium-sized cafes, the process of taking customer orders and managing menus is still handled manually. This often leads to several challenges, including:

1)Order confusion or delays due to verbal communication errors.
2)Inefficient tracking of table-wise orders.
3)Difficulty in updating menus (e.g., price changes, new item additions).
4)Lack of digital payment integration, leading to longer billing times.
5)Poor customer experience due to slow service and limited transparency in the order process.

To remain competitive and improve overall efficiency, there is a need for a digital cafe management solution that simplifies these operations. The system should be easy to use, support real-time order placement, allow dynamic menu management, and integrate secure payment options.
