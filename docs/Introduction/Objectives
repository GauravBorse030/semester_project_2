The main objective of this Cafe Management System is to develop a user-friendly digital platform that streamlines the entire order and menu management process within a cafe. This system is designed to:

Enable customers to place orders digitally from their table using a web interface.

Provide an interactive admin panel where staff can:

1)Add new food items.
2)Edit food prices and images.
3)Delete outdated menu items.
4)Automatically assign orders to specific table numbers for better tracking.
5)Maintain an up-to-date order summary for chefs and staff to view and manage orders efficiently.
6)Facilitate quick and secure payment through integrated UPI QR code options.

Ultimately, the project aims to reduce manual errors, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve operational efficiency inside the cafe.
