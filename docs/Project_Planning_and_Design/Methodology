--------------Methodology / Approach Used for the Project----------------------
The development of the Cafe Management System follows a structured and iterative approach based on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The steps below outline the complete process:

1. Requirement Analysis
Conducted discussions with cafe staff and potential users to understand the workflow and pain points.

Key needs identified: digital menu access, real-time order placement, chefâ€™s dashboard, food item management via admin panel.

2. System Design
Frontend Design: Created a responsive and user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Backend Design: Designed a scalable backend using Django, a high-level Python web framework.

Database Schema: Modeled using SQLite, defining tables for FoodItems, Orders, Tables, etc.

3. Implementation
Frontend Integration: Menu page built to allow customers to select items and view totals.

Django Views & Models: Connected frontend to backend, allowing data flow from form to database.

Admin Panel Customization: Enabled adding, editing, deleting food items and updating prices/images via Django admin.

4. Testing
Unit and integration testing performed to ensure proper working of order flow, admin panel, and customer interface.

Fixed bugs like missing image paths, incorrect price totals, and invalid inputs.

5. Deployment & Hosting
Configured settings.py for static and media files.

Local deployment tested using runserver; ready for production deployment on platforms like Heroku or PythonAnywhere.

6. Feedback & Iteration
Feedback taken from test users (students, cafe owners).

Iterative improvements made such as image previews, QR integration for table-specific ordering, and payment QR code display.
