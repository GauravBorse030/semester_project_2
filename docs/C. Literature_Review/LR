Several research works and systems have been developed to improve order handling, menu management, and customer experience in cafes and restaurants. Below are summaries of key existing systems:

1. Restaurant Ordering System Using Mobile Devices

2. QR Code Menu & Ordering
    >Customers scan a QR code on their table to access a digital menu.
    >Orders are placed directly from their phones, reducing dependency on wait staff.

3. Online Food Ordering Platforms
    >Platforms like Zomato, Swiggy, and Uber Eats allow online ordering and delivery.
    >Useful for cafes offering takeout or home delivery services.

4. Custom Web-based Ordering Systems
    >Many small cafes now prefer having a custom web app tailored to their menu, table layout, and branding.
    >Provides full control over design, data, and pricing.
    >Usually built using:
        Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
        Backend: Python (Django)
        Database: SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL

5. Admin Management Dashboards
    >Allow staff to add/update/delete food items, manage pricing, view orders, and update status.
    >Often integrated into the main web system using frameworks like Django Admin, React Admin, etc.
